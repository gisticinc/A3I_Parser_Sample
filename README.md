# Overview

Python code samples are presented here for making A3I address parsing service requests.

An API key is required to use the services.  You may contact Gistic for the key. 

The python scripts are developed for Python 2.

# Sample 1 - python.py

Shows the basic use of the service. Here is the sample command line 

  `python python.py <a3i_key>`

# Sample 2 - python_excel_file.py

The code sample reads a specified column as input addresses in the first tab of an excel spreadsheet and puts the parsed result in `result.xls`
in your working folder.  Here is how to evoke the command line:

  `python python_excel_file.py <source_excel.xls> <address_column_name> <a3i_key>`
